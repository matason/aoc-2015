My attempt at [Advent of Code, 2015](https://adventofcode.com/) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

I've no doubt that I set the project up incorrectly, I'll fix it when I've learned how to! It seems onerous to have to add a [[bin]] section to Cargo.toml for each day and running the code also seems fiddly...

Anyway, for now, to run the test(s) for a particular day and part, run `cd day01 && cargo test --bin part1` (or `cd day01 && cargo test --` to suppress the hiding of stout) and to run the puzzle, run `cd day01 && cargo run --bin part1`.

Run at your own risk ðŸ˜˜
